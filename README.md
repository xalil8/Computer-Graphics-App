# Computer-Graphics-App using Pyqt5 and OpenGL python-!

This GitHub repository contains a basic example of a 3D cube rendered using OpenGL. A simple user interface, built using PyQT5, allows for the manipulation of the cube, including rotation, translation, and scaling, as well as the application of mirror and shear effects. 

To create an executable file from the Python code, the PyInstaller package must be installed. Once installed, navigate to the location of the PyInstaller executable and run the command "python [path to pyinstaller.exe] --onefile --noconsole main.py" in the console to create a standalone executable file.
